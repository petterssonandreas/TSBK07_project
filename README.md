# TSBK07_project
Repo for the project **Snow Simulator** in the course TSBK07. Written by Jonas Ehn and Andreas Pettersson.

The project is written using Visual Studio 2017. Release build is currently *not* working, only debug. However, the debug version can be run in VS 2017 without debugging.

A makefile for Linux is included. It is tested and is working. However, due to the usage of an SSBO the program is very hardware-dependent, meaning an untested plattform may not work with the current SSBO size.

Some files are provided by the examiner of the course TSBK07 on Link√∂ping University.
